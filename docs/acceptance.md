# Acceptance Snapshot — 24-Hour Visual Time Clock

Use this template to capture validation notes for success criteria SC-001 through SC-005.

| Criteria                                                      | Observation | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- |
| SC-001: Identify current hour within 2 seconds                |             |           |       |
| SC-002: Count elapsed hours in under 5 seconds                |             |           |       |
| SC-003: Visualization updates within 5 seconds of hour change |             |           |       |
| SC-004: Page loads and renders in ≤ 2 seconds on broadband    |             |           |       |
| SC-005: Users interpret dim vs bright states correctly        |             |           |       |

**Testing Tips**

- Watch the header meta row for current time and elapsed count.
- Observe the current card during an hour rollover; ensure past hour dimming happens promptly.
- Use dev tools' “Performance” or “Network” tabs to gauge load time if needed.
- Gather informal user feedback or heuristics to confirm comprehension of visual states.
