# Specification Quality Checklist: 24-Hour Visual Time Clock

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Strengths

1. **Clear user value**: Three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
2. **Comprehensive requirements**: 13 functional requirements covering grid layout, visual states, time tracking, and real-time updates
3. **Measurable success criteria**: 5 technology-agnostic metrics focusing on user experience (time to understand, load time, update latency, comprehension rate)
4. **Well-defined assumptions**: 6 assumptions documented to clarify design decisions and constraints
5. **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3 testable scenarios using Given-When-Then format
6. **Appropriate edge cases**: 5 edge cases identified covering timezone issues, midnight transitions, and browser behavior

### Notes

- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- Specification follows template structure perfectly
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation
