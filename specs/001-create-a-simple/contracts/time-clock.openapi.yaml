  description: |
    The 24-hour visual time clock feature derives all state from the user's local system clock
    and does not require server-side APIs. This specification remains empty to signal that no
    backend endpoints are needed for the current scope. Should future requirements introduce
    synchronized or shared time data, endpoints MUST be defined here.
