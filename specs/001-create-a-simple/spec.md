# Feature Specification: 24-Hour Visual Time Clock

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a simple webpage, that shows todays hours in a 6 \* 4 matrix, the top left is the 0:00 , the bottom right is 23:00 , each hour is a round clock, when the clock is ran out, it goes to dark, thie webpage represents todays time"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Visual Time Awareness at a Glance (Priority: P1)

A user visits the webpage and immediately sees a visual representation of the entire day (00:00 to 23:00) as a grid of 24 circular clocks arranged in a 6×4 matrix. Hours that have already passed in the current day appear dark/dimmed, while the current hour and future hours remain visible/bright. This provides instant awareness of how much of the day has elapsed.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing an intuitive, visual way to understand time passage throughout the day. Without this, there is no feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the webpage at any time of day and verifying that hours before the current time are darkened while current and future hours remain visible. Delivers immediate value as a time awareness tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** it is 14:30 (2:30 PM), **When** user opens the webpage, **Then** clocks for hours 00:00-13:00 (14 clocks) are darkened, and clocks for hours 14:00-23:00 (10 clocks) remain visible/bright
2. **Given** it is 00:15 (12:15 AM), **When** user opens the webpage, **Then** clock for hour 00:00 is darkened, and all other 23 clocks remain visible
3. **Given** it is 23:45 (11:45 PM), **When** user opens the webpage, **Then** clocks for hours 00:00-22:00 are darkened, and only the clock for 23:00 remains visible

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Day Progress Updates (Priority: P2)

As time progresses while the user has the webpage open, the visualization updates automatically without requiring a page refresh. When a new hour begins, the clock for the previous hour transitions to the darkened state, providing continuous feedback about day progression.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability for users who keep the page open throughout the day. Without this, users would need to manually refresh to see updates, reducing the tool's effectiveness as a passive time awareness aid.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the page a few minutes before an hour transition and observing that the previous hour's clock darkens when the new hour begins. Delivers value as a live dashboard for time awareness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opened the page at 09:45 and it is now 10:00, **When** the clock reaches the top of the hour, **Then** the clock for 09:00 transitions to darkened state without page reload
2. **Given** the webpage has been open for 3 hours, **When** user looks at the display, **Then** exactly 3 additional clocks have become darkened since opening the page
3. **Given** it is 23:59:50, **When** the clock transitions to midnight (00:00), **Then** all clocks reset to visible state as a new day begins

### User Story 3 - Clear Hour Labels for Easy Reference (Priority: P3)

Each clock in the grid displays its corresponding hour label (00:00, 01:00, 02:00... through 23:00), allowing users to quickly identify specific hours without counting positions in the matrix.

**Why this priority**: Improves usability and reduces cognitive load, but the feature could still function without labels since position indicates time. This is an enhancement for clarity and ease of use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining any clock in the grid and verifying it shows the correct hour label matching its position (top-left = 00:00, bottom-right = 23:00). Delivers value by making the interface more user-friendly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views the grid, **When** looking at the top-left clock, **Then** it displays "00:00" or "0:00"
2. **Given** user views the grid, **When** looking at the bottom-right clock, **Then** it displays "23:00"
3. **Given** user views the grid, **When** examining all 24 clocks, **Then** each displays its corresponding hour in sequential order from 00:00 to 23:00

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user's system clock is incorrect or changes timezone while the page is open?
- How does the system handle the transition at midnight (23:59 to 00:00) - should all clocks reset to bright?
- What if the user opens the page in multiple browser tabs or windows - do they all update synchronously?
- How should the visualization handle daylight saving time transitions (when an hour is skipped or repeated)?
- What happens if the user's browser tab is inactive/backgrounded for a long period - does it update when they return?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a grid of exactly 24 circular clocks arranged in 6 rows and 4 columns
- **FR-002**: System MUST position hour 00:00 in the top-left position of the grid
- **FR-003**: System MUST position hour 23:00 in the bottom-right position of the grid
- **FR-004**: System MUST arrange hours sequentially from left-to-right, top-to-bottom (00:00, 01:00, 02:00... 05:00 in row 1; 06:00, 07:00... 11:00 in row 2, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display each hour as a circular clock element
- **FR-006**: System MUST darken/dim clocks representing hours that have completely elapsed in the current day
- **FR-007**: System MUST keep clocks visible/bright for the current hour and all future hours
- **FR-008**: System MUST determine current time based on the user's local system time
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the visualization in real-time as time progresses without requiring page refresh
- **FR-010**: System MUST transition each clock to darkened state when its corresponding hour ends
- **FR-011**: System MUST reset all clocks to visible state when a new day begins (at 00:00)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display the time label for each hour on or near its clock (e.g., "00:00", "01:00", etc.)
- **FR-013**: System MUST work as a standalone webpage viewable in standard web browsers
- **FR-014**: Each clock MUST display only clock hands (hour, minute, and second) without numbers or tick marks on the face
- **FR-015**: Clocks for elapsed hours MUST show hands frozen at the end of their hour (e.g., the 09:00 clock displays 10:00)
- **FR-016**: Clocks for upcoming hours MUST show hands pointing to the 12:00 position
- **FR-017**: The current hour clock MUST display a live analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands
- **FR-018**: The current hour clock's second hand MUST update once per second with discrete ticks
- **FR-019**: The current hour clock's hour hand MUST progress gradually through the hour to reflect real-time position

### Key Entities

- **Hour Clock**: Represents a single hour of the day (00:00 through 23:00), with attributes for its time value, position in the grid, and visual state (darkened/visible)
- **Day State**: Represents the current day's progression, tracking which hours have elapsed and the current time

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can determine the current hour within 2 seconds of viewing the webpage
- **SC-002**: Users can identify how many hours have elapsed in the current day by counting darkened clocks in under 5 seconds
- **SC-003**: The visualization updates to reflect hour changes within 5 seconds of the system clock reaching a new hour
- **SC-004**: The webpage loads and displays all 24 clocks within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections
- **SC-005**: 90% of users can correctly interpret the darkened vs. visible clock states without additional instructions

## Assumptions

- Users access the webpage from devices with accurate system clocks set to their local timezone
- The "darkened" visual state means reduced opacity, grayscale, or similar visual treatment that clearly distinguishes elapsed hours from current/future hours
- "Circular clock" refers to a minimalist analog face rendered with hands only; additional markings or numerals are deliberately omitted
- The webpage is intended for desktop/laptop browsers with reasonable viewport sizes (minimum 800×600 pixels assumed)
- Real-time updates for hour transitions can have up to 5-10 seconds of latency; the live second hand continues ticking once per second per FR-018
- A "completed/ran out" hour means the current time has progressed past that hour (e.g., at 14:30, hours 00:00-13:00 have "ran out")
